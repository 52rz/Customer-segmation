Customer segmentation with SQL is super important to level up your marketing campaign game. By following this guide, you’ll unlock the power of SQL to better understand your customers. That means you can create ads and campaigns that really speak to them.

And guess what? Happier customers mean more sales for your business!

I’ve personally used segmentation in large-scale marketing campaigns for personalization and really super-targeted email campaigns. I’ve also used it to figure out which customers are most profitable so that my clients can offer discounts and rewards.

But built-in vendor dashboards really suck at this.
If you don’t have control over your data with SQL, you’re missing out.
Wasting time and money on generic marketing campaigns
Stuck with basic, vendor dashboards with built-in segmentation
Failing to automate and scale your data-driven marketing efforts
Trusting your gut instead of relying on the data to make decisions
Fortunately, there’s a better way.

This guide will take you step-by-step through the entire process, including the code you need to be successful. By the end of the guide, you’ll be out of “Excel hell” and understand your customers better than anyone on your team.

Take a deep breath and let’s dive in together:

Step 1:****** 

Set up the tables
First, let’s build a solid foundation for your data-driven marketing journey.

Here’s the SQL code to set up a sample set of customer records that would be useful for customer segmentation.

Step 2:****************
Add your data
Next, we’ll collect and store your most valuable customer data.

You have two options here:

Option 1: Import from a CSV file
Option 2: Import using INSERT statements
If you have your data in a CSV file, then go with option 1. If not, go with option 2.

Option 1: Import from a CSV file:

2. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a tool like psql, pgAdmin, or any other client you prefer. I wrote more about this process recently.

Step 3:********
Develop some insights
After that, we’ll hunt for some “hidden gems” by analyzing the data.

This step can take some time, thinking and “playing around” with the data. But after a while, you’ll get the hang of it as your SQL skills develop.


Here are two example insights based on the data (follow along online here if you don’t want to set up your own database)
